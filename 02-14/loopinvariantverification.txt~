public static int max(int[] arr) {
int ret = arr[0];
for (int i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
if (arr[i] < ret) {
ret = arr[i];
}
}
return ret;
}

This particular max implementation does NOT enforce the loop invariant
properly. This is because within the method the comparison actually ensures
the minimum value in the array is returned rather than the maximum. The
condition is if arr{i}<ret then ret=arr[i]; this means if the current array
element is less than ret, then ret changes to that lesser value. At the end
of the loop this value is returned.

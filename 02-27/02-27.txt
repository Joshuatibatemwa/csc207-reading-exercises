I i = new C();
i.foo(); // (A)
i.bar(); // (B)
For lines (A) and (B) above, answer the following questions:
1. Does the line of code type check?
A- Yes it does
B- No it doesn't

2. If so, what is the output?

A-C.foo


Subtyping is very precise. bar is safe however it is rejected by Java's
type system
